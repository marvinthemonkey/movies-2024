<h3>1.The Matrix</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.fandom.com/wiki/The_Matrix">The Matrix</a> has aways been my top movie, ever since i saw it last year. It has everything!
Its a sci-fi action film, starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Joe Pantoliano and Hugo Weaving.The film describes a future in which reality perceived by humans is actually the Matrix
(a simulated reality created by sentient Machines in order to subdue the human populationwhile their bodies heat/electrical activity are used as an energy source). I first saw this movie when i was looking 
through the family dvds downstairs and my parents recommended it to me. I watched all 3 dvds we had downstairs that same day..Now i have all 3 dvds for myself, i found a set of all 3 for 50p so i bought that 
immediately and without hesistation. Only part that freaks me out everytime is when Neo wakes up in the Real World(the Matrix)after choosing the red pill(the best choice) and hes covered in that goo and those 
plug holes. Best movie ever made, best movie i've ever seen, best movie to exist. End of discussion.</p>

<h3>2.Donnie Darko</h3>
<p><a href="https://wakeupdonnie.fandom.com/wiki/Donnie_Darko">Donnie Darko</a> is a masterpeice. Once the movie was over i just sat there for what felt like days when really it was probably only 20 minutes.
im gonna be honest, i didnt understand the ending. like, AT ALL. i must have looked at at least 5 or 6 websites to try understand it but i feel like i have to watch it all over again now i know whats going on
just so i can properly know whats going on. ANYWAY, 10/10 movie, love young Jake Gyllenhaal (maybe not old though..). The movie is about Donald Darko, or donnie, who sleepwalks on october 2, 1988, and sees 
something in a really weird rabbit suit who introduces himself as Frank. He says the world will end in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes and 12 seconds.He's taking medication but i dont think we find out what for,
presumably schizophrenia but Frank makes him do a lot of thinks while he's sleep walking, like put an axe in the schools water supply and flood the school. no spoilers but i did NOT know that was jims house
he was in until the morning of and hes being hauled out by the police. Its said that Donnie was a "living receiver" whatever that means. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!! </p>

<h3>3.The Social Network</h3> <!--new-->
<p><a href="https://movies.fandom.com/wiki/The_Social_Network">The Social Network</a>(2010)is a movie depictingthe life of a young Mark Zuckerburg(Facebooks founder if you didnt know) I bought the dvd maybe early 
january(?) and watched it the same day. It took me a while (probably too long) to realise that its multiple perceptions at once and not in chronological order ALL the time...It stars Jesse Eisenberg (again),
Andrew Garfielf and Justin Timberlake, i have to be honest, i did NOT expect Andrew to be in this, when i saw him i thought he would be a background character and not a massively involved character. I 
<u>also</u> only just realised about 20 minutes ago that the guy playing Eduardo was Justin Timberlake. IN MY DEFENCE THOUGH i never really knew his face, i had only heard of his music or his name in random articles. 
My favourite part of the movie though is quite near the beginning, when Mark is vlogging about his ex and his website is called "ZuckOnThat". I think the movie is based off a book from 2009, "The Accidental
Billionares:The Founding of Facebook, A tale of Sex, Money, and Betrayal. I dont want to know about his sex life but its whatever.</p>

<h3>4.SLC Punk!</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.filmaffinity.com/en/film973030.html">SLC Punk</a> was one of those movies i watched because i thought i could be interesting, but i didnt think i would like it so much.I haven't
watched SLCP in so long i need a catchup but its still in my top5 cause why wouldnt it be? its one of the best and only films about punk culture? I watched a video about it and was looking for a new movie to
 watch so when i did, i was amazed. I was also sobbing my heart out but thats irrelavent...(R.I.P) It stars Matthew Lillard, Michael Goorjian and Annabeth Gish and follows the life of Stevo and Heroin Bob
 (who doesnt actually take heroin, long story). Stevo and Bob are the only 2 dedicated Punks in a conservative Salt Lake City. This movie was released in 1998 and runs for an hour 40. I would kill to to watch
 this for the first time again. 10/10, its GREAT.</p>


<h3>5.Dodgeball</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.filmaffinity.com/en/film888985.html"> Dodgeball:A True Underdog Story</a> is a HIGHLY underrated movie, seriously. Its just 90 minutes of weird jokes, some obvious, some less obvious. 
It stars a lot of people and im not naming everyone but Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn and Christine Taylor star in it. My favourite character has to be Justin(played by Justin Long), although hes not very sporty...
He's also in Accepted which i watched for the first time this month and i have to say, i dont know what i expected but i did not expect justin to jump on stage and start singing the Ramones, OR him transforming
an old abandoned mental asylum into his fake college. Dodgeball came out in 2004 but you really can't tell. Again, i have the dvd so its one of my prized possesions!</p>
