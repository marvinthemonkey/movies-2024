<h3>1.The Matrix</h3>
<p><a href="https://matrix.fandom.com/wiki/The_Matrix">The Matrix</a> has aways been my top movie, ever since i saw it last year. It has everything!
Its a sci-fi action film, starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Joe Pantoliano and Hugo Weaving.The film describes a future in which reality perceived by humans is actually the Matrix
(a simulated reality created by sentient Machines in order to subdue the human populationwhile their bodies heat/electrical activity are used as an energy source). I first saw this movie when i was looking 
through the family dvds downstairs and my parents recommended it to me. I watched all 3 dvds we had downstairs that same day..Now i have all 3 dvds for myself, i found a set of all 3 for 50p so i bought that 
immediately and without hesistation. Only part that freaks me out everytime is when Neo wakesup in the Real World(the Matrix)after choosing the red pill(the best choice) and hes covered in that goo and those 
plug holes. Best movie ever made, best movie i've ever seen, best movie to exist. End of discussion.</p>

<h3>2.Wayne's World</h3>
<p>I first watched <a href="https://fictionalcrossover.fandom.com/wiki/Wayne%27s_World">Wayne's World</a> in the summer of 2022 with my mum and my brother. i watched it almost everyday since then that
summer. I currently have it on dvd and got a dvd player for my birthday last year so i think its safe to say ive probaby watched this movie too many times to COUNT! It stars Mike Myers and Dana Carvey who
started Waynes World as an SNL sketch series, but got turned in a movie in 1992, with the second movie(Waynes World 2) in 1993, which i dont ownðŸ˜­ </p>

<h3>3.SLC Punk!</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.filmaffinity.com/en/film973030.html">SLC Punk</a> was one of those movies i watched because i thought i could be interesting, but i didnt think i would like it so much. I watched a 
video about it and was looking for a new movie to watch so when i did, i was amazed. I was also sobbing my heart out but thats irrelavent...(R.I.P) It stars Matthew Lillard, Michael Goorjian and Annabeth
Gish and follows the life of Stevo and Heroin Bob (who doesnt actually take heroin, long story). Stevo and Bob are the only 2 dedicated Punks in a conservative Salt Lake City. This movie was released in 1998
 and runs for an hour 40. What i would do to watch this for the first time again. 10/10, life changing.</p>


<h3>4.Dodgeball</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.filmaffinity.com/en/film888985.html"> Dodgeball:A True Underdog Story</a> is a HIGHLY underrated movie, seriously. Its just 90 minutes of weird jokes, some obvious, some less obvious. 
It stars a lot of people and im not naming everyone but Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn and Christine Taylor star in it. My favourite character has to be Justin(played by Justin Long), although hes not very sporty...
This movie came out in 2004 but is still very relavant in day-to-day life today. Again, i have the dvd so its one of my prized possesions!</p>

<h3>5.Zombieland</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/zombieland/">Zombieland</a> is a more recent movie i watched. I think i first saw it very late december, maybe the 29th? But i was really happy to see Jesse 
Eisenberg in it! Emma Stone, Woody Harrelson and Abigail Breslin were also in Zombieland. BUT, i didnt expect to see Bill Murray or Amber Heard, but Bill was a much more pleasant surpirse. I'm gonna be honest,
I didnt even realise 406 was Amber Heard until doing my research for this review/description thingy! Shows how many actors i know..But, i love zombies and I also loved Adventureland which is also Eisenberg, and
they were both released almost exactly 6 months apart in 2009, although Adventureland came first in April.</p>
